# Runs_Progression_Chart

This repository contains a Python script for generating interactive Runs Progression Charts using Plotly. The script takes cricket match data as input and visualizes the runs scored by each team over the course of the match, highlighting key phases such as Powerplay, Middle Overs, and Death Overs. The chart includes markers for wickets and vertical dashed lines to denote important milestones. This tool is useful for cricket enthusiasts and analysts to visually analyze the flow of runs and wickets during a cricket match.
