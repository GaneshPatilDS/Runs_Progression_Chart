# Runs_Progression_Chart

📊 This repository contains a Python script 🐍 for generating interactive Runs Progression Charts 🏏 using Plotly. The script takes cricket match data 📈 as input and visualizes the runs scored by each team over the course of the match, highlighting key phases such as Powerplay, Middle Overs, and Death Overs. The chart includes markers for wickets 🎯 and vertical dashed lines to denote important milestones. This tool is useful for cricket enthusiasts and analysts 🧑‍🔬 to visually analyze the flow of runs and wickets during a cricket match.

For example, one can use this script to create a Runs Progression Chart 📈 for the IPL match between Mumbai Indians (MI) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG). The chart will illustrate the runs scored by both teams throughout the match, showcasing the momentum shifts and key moments 🏏.
